# VR Tools
Some tools I made that I find useful for VR. **Requires running as administrator to work!**
## Building
1. Download the latest [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
2. Download the source code
3. Open powershell in the `VR_Tools` folder and run `dotnet build .\VR_Tools.sln`
4. The .exe file is in `\VR_Tools\VR_Tools.Desktop\bin\Debug\net8.0\win-x64`
